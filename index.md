My name is Sarah, and in the tech community, I go by Sadukie. Psodukie is a play on my Sadukie nickname and my psoriatic diagnoses. After a couple years of battles, Iâ€™m finally coming up for air and ready to share my adventures with psoriatic disease and my other diagnoses. So check out the blog for my adventures with:

- Psoriasis
- Psoriatic Arthritis
- Endometriosis
- RPGN
- Chronic Kidney Disease
