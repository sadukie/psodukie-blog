title: "Fighting the Effects on my Eyes - Allergy Season"
---

Over the past couple years, I've been fighting complications with my eyes. What the optometrist thought was a mite infestation turned out to be blepharitis. Thanks to my rheumatologist for catching that. I also have dry eyes. Blepharitis and dry eyes are known [ophthalmological changes associated with psoriasis](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8311223/).

Since we're in allergy season, I also have eye drops for allergies. In addition to those, I have hydration drops that I'm supposed to use throughout the day. I also have heat therapy that I can do in 20-minute chunks - which I usually do at the beginning of the day.

Allergy season is brutal this year. Sinuses are unhappy. Eyes are unhappy. So I've gotten better about the eye therapies. Today, I started the heat therapy back up again.

When I do heat therapy on my eyes, I use a USB eye mask with a timer and heat level control. I went with a USB mask because of traveling, and it's been working well. I usually just listen to music while letting the heat work its magic.

Today's Heat Therapy songs included:

- [Kevin Olusola's "Hallelujah"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqraMomK7G8)
- [Kevin Olusola's "Dark Winter"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKRM0oqI_sw)
- ["From Now On" from The Greatest Showman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW2FUY3N-n0&pp=ygULZnJvbSBub3cgb24%3D)
- ["The Greatest Show" from The Greatest Showman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NyVYXRD1Ans&pp=ygUSdGhlIGdyZWF0ZXN0IHNob3cg)
- ["This Is Me" from The Greatest Showman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEJd2RyGm8Q&pp=ygUKdGhpcyBpcyBtZQ%3D%3D)
- [Kevin Olusola's "Smile"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f74R6BYze4A)

One perk of listening to music during this means that I can also sing along with it, which is important for me for keeping my lungs strong and getting ready for giving talks.

Sometimes, my eyes look really bad to others. Sometimes, they hurt really badly but look fine to others. It's tough to explain to others that while my eyes look ok, they aren't ok.

Now, I'm ready to take on the day. But man... these eyes need to get better.
