title: "Psoriatic Arthritis - Feeling Like a House Case"
---

About a month after my psoriasis diagnosis, I noticed I had some severe pains appearing in my hands. When I returned to dermatology for a follow-up, I showed them my hands and said ‚ÄúI need help. These hurt.‚Äù They were able to refer me to the local rheumatologist.

In my last blog post, I mentioned that I had heard nightmares about getting specialist appointments. Rheumatology fits that pattern. I had to wait 3 months before I could get into the rheumatologist. Heating pads, compression gloves, and rest were what I had to work with. But it was frustrating for me to understand what was going on. Was this the arthritis component that can come with psoriasis? ü§î

When I finally got into rheumatology, I was introduced to the secrets of bloodwork. In order to get to a psoriatic arthritis diagnosis in the US, having psoriasis isn‚Äôt enough. There were still many blood tests I had to go through in order to get there.

They tested my [rheumatoid factor](https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/rheumatoid-factor/about/pac-20384800). In this test, they saw a negative result, which gave some insight into the weirdness known as my body. However, this test alone doesn‚Äôt lead to a conclusive diagnosis. It‚Äôs just a piece of the puzzle.

My [Sed rate](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diagnostics/17747-sed-rate-erythrocyte-sedimentation-rate-or-esr-test) was tested, and my inflammation markers were high. So we knew my body was truly in an unhappy state.

The largest of the tests I had to go through was [the ANA](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diagnostics/14897-antinuclear-antibody-test-in-children) ‚Äì a test for Anti-Nuclear Antibodies. Certain results are indicative of autoimmune diseases, and one of my titers came back suspicious. The ANA results indicated a pattern that had a higher rate, so we had a list of diseases to consider and eliminate.

With the ANA results, we had to eliminate more diseases in order to back into the psoriatic arthritis diagnosis:

- Not lupus
- Not Sj√∂gren‚Äôs Syndrome
- Not scleroderma
- Not myositis
- Not mixed connective tissue disease

By process of elimination, we eventually were able to back into the psoriatic arthritis diagnosis. With a diagnosis, we can finally start treatment!
